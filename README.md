# languageLengthComparer
In this project, I wanted to test an hypothesis that Spanish words are shorter than French words.

Let S be the mean length of a Spanish word, while F be the mean length of a French word.

Let H0 be (S = F), while Ha is (S < F).

Given a corpus of some Spanish and French text, I determined there was not enough evidence to reject H0:
there is no difference in mean word length.
